# Project-Lithosphere
Two stage bootloader
Initialy conceived as part of Project-Troposphere.\
Due to well desired simplicty in porccess of making the OS (as i was still just a begginer at the time of writing), i decided to switch to GRUB bootloader.\
In order not to throw all my previous code down the drain, and saving the possibility to one day come back to this part of system and continue improving it i gave this part of Project-Troposphere the appropriate name and reallocated all files.\
Start date: 10.02.2021.\
